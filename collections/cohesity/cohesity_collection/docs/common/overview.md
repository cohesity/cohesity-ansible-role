This project provides an Ansible role for interacting with [Cohesity DataPlatform](https://www.cohesity.com/products/data-platform).

Leveraging Python, this Ansible role can be used on Windows, Linux, or MacOS.

It includes modules, tasks, and example plays that are useful for automating common tasks in your environment.

The Cohesity Ansible Role employs Cohesity's REST API to interact with Cohesity DataPlatform.
