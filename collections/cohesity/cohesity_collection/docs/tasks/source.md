## Synopsis
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

Use this task to add and configure Cohesity Protection Sources.

#### How It Works
- The task starts by determining if the named endpoint exists in the cluster.
- Upon validation, the task creates a new Protection Source (*state=present*) or removes the existing Protection Source (*state=absent*) from the cluster.
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  When *state=absent*, there are no job validations or state checks to ensure that backups are not running.  If jobs exist for the Source, an error is raised and the task fails.

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

* Cohesity DataPlatform running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Before using this task, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

The following is a list of variables and the configuration expected when leveraging this task in your playbook.  For more information on these variables, see [Cohesity Protection Source](../library/cohesity_source.md).
```yaml
cohesity_source:
  state: present
  endpoint: ""
  environment: ""

## Customize Your Playbooks
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

This example shows how to include the Cohesity Ansible role in your custom playbooks and leverage this task as part of the delivery.

### Create new Physical Protection Sources using the Ansible Inventory
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

This is an example playbook that creates new Protection Sources for all Linux hosts based on the registered inventory hostnames. (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)

Following inventory file can be used in the ansible-playbook runs below. Copy the content to `inventory.ini` file
```ini
[workstation]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

[linux]
10.21.143.240
10.21.143.241

[linux:vars]
ansible_user=cohesity
```
> **Note:**
  - Before using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

You can create a file called `protection_source_physical.yml`, add the contents from the sample playbook, and then run the playbook using `ansible-playbook`:
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> protection_source_physical.yml -e "username=abc password=abc"
  ```

```yaml
---
  - hosts: workstation
    # => Please change these variables to connect
    # => to your Cohesity Cluster
    vars:
        var_cohesity_server: cohesity_cluster_vip
        var_cohesity_admin: admin
        var_cohesity_password: admin
        var_validate_certs: False
    gather_facts: no
    roles:
        - cohesity.cohesity_ansible_role
    tasks:
      - name: Configure Cohesity Protection Source for each Physical Linux Server
        include_role:
            name: cohesity.cohesity_ansible_role
            tasks_from: source
        vars:
            cohesity_server: "{{ var_cohesity_server }}"
            cohesity_admin: "{{ var_cohesity_admin }}"
            cohesity_password: "{{ var_cohesity_password }}"
            cohesity_validate_certs: "{{ var_validate_certs }}"
            cohesity_source:
                state: present
                endpoint: "{{ item }}"
                host_type: "Linux"
        with_items: "{{ groups[linux] }}"
```

### Create new VMware vCenter Protection Source
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

This is an example playbook that creates new Protection Sources for the chosen vCenter host. (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
