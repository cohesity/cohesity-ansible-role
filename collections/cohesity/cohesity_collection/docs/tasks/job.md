## Synopsis
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

Use this task to add and configure Cohesity Protection Jobs.

#### How It Works
- The task starts by determining whether named protection job exists in the cluster.
- Upon validation, the task creates a new Protection job or add physical sources to existing job (*state=present*) or removes the existing Protection job (*state=absent*) from the cluster.
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  When *state=absent*, there are no job validations or state checks to ensure that backups are not running. If job exist and an physical source endpoint is given, the task tries to remove source from the job 

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Before using this task, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

The following is a list of variables and the configuration expected when leveraging this task in your playbook.  For more information on these variables, see [Cohesity Protection Job](../library/cohesity_job.md).
```yaml
cohesity_protection:
  state: present
  job_name: ""
  sources:
     - endpoint: ""
  environment: ""
  storage_domain: DefaultIddStorageDomain
  policy: Bronze
  delete_backups: False
  cancel_active: False
```
## Customize Your Playbooks
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

This example shows how to include the Cohesity Ansible Role in your custom playbooks and leverage this task as part of the delivery.

### Create new Physical Protection Job using the Ansible Inventory
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

This is an example playbook that creates a new Protection Job and adds Physical hosts to the job based on the registered inventory hostname. (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
> **Notes:**
  - Before using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.
  - This example requires that the endpoints matches existing Protection Sources.  See [Task: Cohesity Protection Source Management](tasks/source.md).
  - Make sure includeFilePath and excludeFilePaths exist on the sources

Following inventory file can be used in the ansible-playbook runs below. Copy the content to `inventory.ini` file
```ini
[workstation]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

[linux]
10.21.143.240
10.21.143.241

[linux:vars]
ansible_user=cohesity
```
You can create a file called `protection_job_physical.yml`, add the contents from the sample playbook, and then run the playbook using `ansible-playbook`:
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> protection_job_physical.yml -e "username=abc password=abc"
  ```
