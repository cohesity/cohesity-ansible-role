## Synopsis
[top](#task-cohesity-view-management)

Use this task to create, update and delete a Cohesity view.

#### How It Works
- The task checks if a view with given name already exists. If it exists, it updates the existing view when state is **present** and deletes the view when the state is **absent**
- The task creates a view if the state is **present** and a view with the given name doesn't exist.

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-view-management)

* Cohesity DataPlatform running version 6.4 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher
* [Cohesity Management SDK](https://developer.cohesity.com/apidocs-641.html#/python/getting-started)

> **Notes:**
  - Before using this task, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables
[top](#task-cohesity-view-management)

The following is a list of variables and the configuration expected when leveraging this task in your playbook.  For more information on these variables, see [Cohesity View](../library/cohesity_view.md).
```yaml
cohesity_view:
  state: 
  name: 
  description: 
  storage_domain:
  qos_policy: 
  protocol: 
  case_insensitive: 
  object_key_pattern: 
  inline_dedupe_compression: 
  security:
  quota: 
  nfs_options: 
  smb_options: 
```
## Customize Your Playbooks
[top](#task-cohesity-view-management)

This example shows how to include the Cohesity Ansible role in your custom playbooks and leverage this task.

### Create a view with protocol access to NFS, SMB, and S3
[top](#task-cohesity-view-management)

This is an example playbook that creates a Cohesity view. (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)

Following inventory file can be used for the ansible-playbook runs below. Copy the content to `inventory.ini` file
```ini
[workstation]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

```
> **Note:**
  - Before using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

You can create a file called `create_view.yml`, add the contents from the sample playbook, and then run the playbook using `ansible-playbook`:
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> create_view.yml"
  ```

### Delete a view

    object_key_pattern: "{{ cohesity_view.object_key_pattern | default('') }}"
    inline_dedupe_compression: "{{ cohesity_view.inline_dedupe_compression | default(False) }}"
