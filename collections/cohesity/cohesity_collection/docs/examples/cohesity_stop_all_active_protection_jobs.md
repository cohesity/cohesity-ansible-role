## Synopsis
[top](#Stop-All-Active-Cohesity-Protection-Jobs)

This example play shows how to use information collected by the *cohesity_facts* module to discover all currently active Protection Jobs and cancel each automatically. The source file for this playbook is located at the root of the role in `examples/complete/cohesity_cancel_all_active_jobs.yml`.
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  This example play should be considered for demo purposes only.  This play cancels **all** actively running backups on an existing Cohesity cluster.

#### How It Works
- The play starts by reading all data about the Cohesity cluster and registering a new variable.
- For each active Protection Job, a call is made to cancel the backup.

> **Note:**<br>
This play does not require that the Protection Jobs were created via the Ansible Integration as it discovers **all** active Protection Jobs registered in the cluster.

### Requirements
[top](#Stop-All-Active-Cohesity-Protection-Jobs)

  - A physical or virtual Cohesity system. The modules were developed with Cohesity version 6.1.0
  - Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  - Python version 2.6 or higher

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Prior to using this playbook, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Working with the cohesity_facts Module
[top](#Stop-All-Active-Cohesity-Protection-Jobs)

This play leverages certain data collected as part of the `cohesity_facts` module distributed with the Cohesity Ansible Role.  For more information, see [Cohesity Facts](../library/cohesity_facts.md).

### Find and cancel active Protection Jobs

Here is an example playbook that queries the Cohesity cluster for all Protection Jobs that are currently active and then cancels each job. The source file for this playbook is located at the root of the role in `examples/complete/cohesity_cancel_all_active_jobs.yml`.  (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
