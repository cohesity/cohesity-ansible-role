## Synopsis
[top](#Remove-and-Register-Cohesity-Sources-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

These example plays leverage the Ansible Inventory to dynamically register and remove Protection Sources for supported Environment Types.  The example playbooks are located at the root of the role in [`playbooks/source-management`](../../playbooks/source-management).
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  These example plays should be considered for demo purposes only. These plays registers and removes Physical, VMware, and GenericNas Protection Sources based on the Ansible Inventory.  There are no job validations or state checks to ensure that backups are not running.  If jobs exist for the Source, an error is raised and the play fails.

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Before using this playbook, refer to the [Setup](../common/setup.md) and [How to Use](../common/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables
[top](#Remove-and-Register-Cohesity-Sources-Using-Ansible-Inventory)


| Required | Parameters | Type | Choices/Defaults | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X | **var_cohesity_server** | String | | IP or FQDN for the Cohesity cluster |
| X | **var_cohesity_admin** | String | | Username with which Ansible will connect to the Cohesity cluster |
| X | **var_cohesity_password** | String | | Password belonging to the selected Username.  This parameter is not logged. |
|   | var_validate_certs | Boolean | False | Switch that determines whether SSL Validation is enabled. |

## Ansible Inventory Configuration
[top](#Remove-and-Register-Cohesity-Sources-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

To fully leverage these Ansible Plays, you must configure your Ansible Inventory file with certain keys and values. This makes it much easier to manage the overall experience. See [Configure Your Ansible Inventory](../common/configuring-your-ansible-inventory.md).

This is an example inventory file: (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
```ini
[workstation]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

[linux]
10.2.46.96
10.2.46.97
10.2.46.98
10.2.46.99

[linux:vars]
type=Linux
ansible_user=root

[windows]
10.2.45.88
10.2.45.89
10.2.48.77

[windows:vars]
type=Windows
ansible_user=administrator
ansible_password=secret
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore

# => Declare the VMware environments to manage.
[vmware]
10.2.x.x

[vmware:vars]
type=VMware
vmware_type=VCenter
source_username=administrator
source_password=password

# => Declare the GenericNas endpoints to manage
[generic_nas]
export_path endpoint="10.2.x.x:/export_path" nas_protocol=NFS
nas_share endpoint="\\\\10.2.x.x\\nas_share"
data endpoint="\\\\10.2.x.x\\data"

# => Default variables for GenericNas endpoints.
[generic_nas:vars]
type=GenericNas
nas_protocol=SMB
nas_username=.\cohesity
nas_password=password
```
