## Synopsis
[top](#cohesity-restore-files)

This Ansible Module supports Physical and GenericNas environments and initiates a file and folder restore operation for the chosen Cohesity Protection Job on a Cohesity cluster.  When executed in a playbook, the Cohesity restore operation is validated and the appropriate restore action is applied.

### Requirements
[top](#cohesity-restore-files)

* Cohesity DataPlatform running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher

> **Note:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.

## Syntax
[top](#cohesity-restore-files)

```yaml
- cohesity_restore_file:
    cluster: <ip or hostname for cohesity cluster>
    username: <cohesity username with cluster level permissions>
    password: <cohesity password for the selected user>
    validate_certs: <boolean to determine if SSL certificates should be validated>
    state: <state of the restore operation>
    name: <assigned descriptor to assign to the Restore Job.  The Restore Job name will consist of the job_name:name format>
    environment: <protection source environment type. For Physical sources this value can be 'Physical' or 'PhysicalFiles'>
    job_name: <selected Protection Job from which the restore will be initated>
    endpoint: <identifies the source endpoint to which the the restore operation will be performed>
    backup_id: <optional Cohesity Backup Run ID for the restore operation.  If not selected, the most recent RunId will be used>
    backup_timestamp: <optional Cohesity Backup Run time. The formart should be YYYY-MM-DD:hh:mm. If not selected, the most recent backup is used>
    file_names:
      - <list of files and folders to be restored by the operation>
    wait_for_job: <boolean to determine if the task should wait for the restore operation to complete prior to moving to the next operation>
    wait_minutes: <number of minutes to wait until the job completes>
    overwrite: <boolean to determine if the restore operation should overwrite the files or folders if they exist>
    preserve_attributes: <boolean to determine if the restore operation should maintain the original file or folder attributes>
    restore_location: <optional location to which the files will be restored>
```

## Examples

### Restore a single file from a Physical Windows Backup
[top](#cohesity-restore-files)

```yaml
- cohesity_restore_file:
    cluster: cohesity.lab
    username: admin
    password: password
    state: present
    name: Restore Single File
    job_name: myhost
    environment: PhysicalFiles
    endpoint: mywindows.host.lab
    file_names:
      - C:\\data\\big_file
    wait_for_job: no
```

### Restore a single file from a GenericNas NFS Backup and wait for the job to complete

    cluster: cohesity.lab
    username: admin
    password: password
    state: present
    name: Restore Single File
    job_name: myhost
    environment: PhysicalFiles
    endpoint: mywindows.host.lab

| Required | Parameters | Type | Choices/Defaults | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X | **cluster** | String | | IP or FQDN for the Cohesity cluster |
| X | **username** | String | | Username with which Ansible will connect to the Cohesity cluster (username used to login to cluster from UI). Domain-specific credentials can be configured as.<br>- username@domain or domain/username (will be deprecated in future).|
| X | **password** | String | | Password belonging to the selected Username (password used to login to cluster from UI).  This parameter is not logged. |

|   | state | Choice | -**present**<br>-absent<br>-started<br>-stopped | Determines the state of the restore operation. |
| X | **name** | String | | Descriptor to assign to the Restore Job.  The Restore Job name will appear in the format: `job_name:name`. |
| X | **job_name** | String | | Name of the Protection Job |
| X | **environment** | Choice | -**PhysicalFiles**<br>-Physical<br>-GenericNas | Specifies the environment type (such as VMware or MS SQL) of the Protection Source this Job is protecting. For Physical protection source, this value can be 'PhysicalFiles' or 'Physical'. 'PhysicalFiles' if the protection job is file based and 'Physical' for block based protection jobs |
| X | **endpoint** | String | | Specifies the network endpoint where the Protection Source is reachable. It can be the URL, hostname, IP address, NFS mount point, or SMB Share of the Protection Source. |
|   | backup_id | String |  | Optional Cohesity ID to use as source for the restore operation.  If not selected, the most recent `RunId` will be used. |
