## Synopsis
[top](#cohesity-policy-management)

The Ansible Module creates or deletes a Protection Policy for the Cohesity Cluster

### Requirements
[top](#cohesity-policy-management)

* Cohesity DataPlatform running version 6.3 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher
* [Cohesity Management SDK](https://developer.cohesity.com/apidocs-641.html#/python/getting-started)

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - When using the default download location, the Cohesity agent installer is placed in `/tmp/<temp-dir`.  If your environment prevents the use of `/tmp` with a `noexec` option, then you must set an alternate location.
