## Synopsis
[top](#cohesity-clone-management)

The Ansible Module is used to clone VMs using snapshots of backup made from VMs.

### Requirements
[top](#cohesity-clone-management)

* Cohesity DataPlatform running version 6.3 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher
* [Cohesity Management SDK](https://developer.cohesity.com/apidocs-641.html#/python/getting-started)

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - When using the default download location, the Cohesity agent installer is placed in `/tmp/<temp-dir`.  If your environment prevents the use of `/tmp` with a `noexec` option, then you must set an alternate location.

## Syntax
[top](#cohesity-clone-management)

```yaml
- cohesity_clone_vm:
    name: <Name of the Clone Task>
    state: <Determines if the Clone Task should be present or absent from in Cohesity Cluster>
    job_name: <Protection Group/Job name from where VM will be cloned>
    view_name: <Specifies the name of the View where the cloned VMs are stored.>
    backup_timestamp: <Specify point in time snapshot using this option. The formart should be YYYY-MM-DD:hh:mm. If not selected, the most recent backup is used>
    environment: <Specify the source environment type. Default is VMware >
    vm_names: <List of the VMs that will be cloned>
    wait_for_job: <Wait for clone task to finish, waits for wait minutes passed to module, default wait minutes is 30 mins>
    prefix: <Add prefix to cloned VM name >
    suffix: <Add suffix to cloned VM name >
    power_on: <Specify if you want cloned VM powered on or off>
    network_conntected: <Specifies whether the network should be left in disabled state. Attached network is enabled by default. Set this flag to true to disable it>
    wait_minutes: <Wait time in minutes, time to wait for clone task>
    resource_pool: <Specifies the resource pool where the cloned VMs are attached.> 
```
