## Synopsis
[top](#cohesity-protection-job)

This Ansible Module is used to register, remove, start, and stop the Cohesity Protection Job on a Cohesity cluster. Additionally this module can also be used update protection sources in a protection job.  When executed in a playbook, the Cohesity Protection Job is validated and the appropriate state action is applied.

### Requirements
[top](#cohesity-protection-job)

* Cohesity DataPlatform running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher

> **Note:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
